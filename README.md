#  Discord Shmot Bot

- **Author:** [Stef Schulz](mailto:s.schulz@slothsoft.de)
- **Repository:** <https://github.com/slothsoft/discord-shmotbot>


My first attempt at a Discord bot.



## Getting Started

### Run Bot Locally

To run the bot locally, you have to do the following:

1. Clone this repository (duh!)
1. Follow [An Idiot's Guide](https://anidiots.guide) until you have a Bot token ready to use and NodeJS installed
1. Install discord packages via command line `npm install`
1. Create a file named *config.json* in the base folder that contains the string `{"token":"YourSuperSecretToken"}`
1. Start bot via command line `node shmotbot.js`
1. Open up discord and see it in action

**Note:** To redeploy it press Control+C and run `node shmotbot.js` again.

### Add Bot to Server

Can you just install this bot to your server? I'm not sure yet.



## Additional Information

- I was following [An Idiot's Guide](https://anidiots.guide)
- I'm not sure what to commit; I'm trying to see what works and what the [internet suggests](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore)
